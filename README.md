# Portfolio

After completing my General Assembly coding bootcamp, one of the last projects that remained was to build my portfolio so I could show off all that I'd accomplished in the previous months!

This portfolio page wasn't meant to be anything too ambitious, just a showcase for what I'd learnt. However, I did use it as a learning opportunity.

* I built the page using **Create-React-App**. This was my first time using it and I was a bit intimidated, especially when it came to deployment. But in the end I was able to make it work perfectly and I'm excited to use it again when building side projects!
* I already had experience using Bulma and Semantic UI, so for this project I wanted to use something different. I went with **React Bootstrap** and found it easy to use and pretty flexible in terms of styling. As always with new CSS frameworks, I struggled with the layout functionality, but eventually I got that working as well.
* A big priority was to make this portfolio **fully-responsive** using media queries. I ended up using three different layers of media-queries to make it adaptable for computers, tablets, and mobile. This was great practice as I hadn't used media queries in a while and was keen to remind myself how to use them! This was really valuable experience but also the most time-consuming part of the project. I reckon I spent 50% of the total project time tinkering with responsiveness related issues. But I think it was time well spent!
